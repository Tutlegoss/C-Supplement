	'<p>The Sparse Matrix project introduced new aspects of programming that could not only be applied in the creation of
	this program but in essentially every program henceforth. Utilizing the power of pointers led straight into the implementation 
	of dynamically allocated arrays. This equally rewarding tool in programming allowed for the usage of arrays without a fixed size. 
	The versatility of arrays that vary in length throughout the duration of the program provided for cleaner and more concise code 
	that flowed flawlessly. A typedef statement was brought forth to make the code less error-prone as the addition of an asterisk is 
	needed when denoting an integer pointer. The successful deletion of the dynamically allocated arrays was crucial at the end of every 
	iteration while the file was being read as to free memory in the heap.</p> 
	
	<p>These tools came together to create a program that explored the rudimentary aspects of memory compression. A matrix was put into a 
	dynamically allocated array. This array was restructured to present each nonzero number in sequence with the omission any zero values 
	in between. The final representation of the matrix was printed to the screen with the help of another dynamically allocated array called 
	the access table. The display of the compressed matrix was formatted such that only nonzero values appeared. The program successfully 
	printed as many matrices as the specified file held and the program was successfully terminated after all matrices were read and restructured.</p>';
