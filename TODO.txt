TODO:
	GENERAL: 
		REFACTOR!
		
		Delete accounts (maybe show on comments)
		
		Get rid of any inline styles (look at navbar.inc.php)
		
		Syntax highlighting on comment code
		
		Copy Code button for example code
        
        DONE! Make navbar work with Safari
        Make login/signup fields smaller for phones
	
	PAGES:
		Forgot.php Have Forgotten password codes expire after a set amount of time
			       Have a new code every time user uses Forgot.php

		Signup.php Remove placeholders on Signup and make them into an info icon

		ResetPass.php Maybe re-evaluate the return values as the logic is awkward.

		index.php Add links to Topic pages and blog

		navbar.php Change inline style to main.css
		
		DONE! Generator.php Output needs to be more than one line long
		
		Login.php have a link to change password (maybe same as Forgot.php)
		
		comments.inc.php refactor the comment queries. Look at: 
			https://www.toptal.com/php/10-most-common-mistakes-php-programmers-make
			$data = [];
			if (count($ids)) {
				$result = $connection->query("SELECT `x`, `y` FROM `values` WHERE `id` IN (" . implode(',', $ids));
				while ($row = $result->fetch_row()) {
					$data[] = $row;
				}
			}
        comments.inc.php ensure no empty comments / no pure whitespace comments
