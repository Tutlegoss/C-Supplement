# C-Supplement

C++ Supplement for Kent State - Stark.

This website is tailored to the CS courses at Kent State - Stark.
Features: accounts, topic supplements, quiz questions (multiple choice), comments, personal blog highlighting C++ misconceptions and other topics of my choice.

**This is currently a work in progress and is currently incomplete.**

Site has current issues for extra small viewports, such as the login/signup form fields go too far to the right and 'off the page'. Please use landscape mode for now. ~~Additionally, there is an issue with the navbar on Safari and is hard to fix without any Apple products, currently.~~ Please use Edge, Firefox, Opera, or Chrome as I can readily test these browsers wth ease. Thank you.

TODO:

**- [x]** Make navbar work with Safari

- [ ] Make login/signup fields smaller for phones

- [ ] Syntax highlighting on comment code

- [ ] Copy Code button for example code

- [ ] Delete accounts (maybe show on comments)

- [ ] Forgot.php Have Forgotten password codes expire after a set amount of time. Have a new code every time user uses Forgot.php

- [ ] Signup.php Remove placeholders on Signup and make them into an info icon

- [ ] ResetPass.php Maybe re-evaluate the return values as the logic is awkward.

- [ ] index.php Add links to Topic pages and blog

- [ ] navbar.php Change inline style to main.css

- [x] Generator.php Output needs to be more than one line long

- [ ] Login.php have a link to change password (maybe same as Forgot.php)

- [ ] comments.inc.php refactor the comment queries.

- [ ] comments.inc.php ensure no empty comments / no pure whitespace comments
