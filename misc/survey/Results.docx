I really need to review data structures and sorting algorithms. I feel like I barely survived CSII.

How C++ is used in a 3D space and different ways C++ could be used in real world situations.

Loops in general and when to use which ones

I briefly went over pointers in my c++ class but it is still very confusing to me conceptually. Also I feel visually representing arrays is largely missed in a lot of text books. I am a visual learner so I usually have to physically write my arrays first before coding them. 

What kind of real world projects CS Students can explore. I have done research online and found very little about what specific projects intermediate C++ programmers can do to advance their knowledge.
